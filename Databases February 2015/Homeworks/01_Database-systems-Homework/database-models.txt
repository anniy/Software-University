Object-oriented database management systems

Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMSs) combine database capabilities with object-oriented programming language capabilities. 
OODBMSs allow object-oriented programmers to develop the product, store them as objects, and replicate or modify existing objects to make new objects within the OODBMS. 
Because the database is integrated with the programming language, the programmer can maintain consistency within one environment, 
in that both the OODBMS and the programming language will use the same model of representation. Relational DBMS projects, 
by way of contrast, maintain a clearer division between the database model and the application.

As the usage of web-based technology increases with the implementation of Intranets and extranets, companies have a vested interest in OODBMSs to display their complex data. 
Using a DBMS that has been specifically designed to store data as objects gives an advantage to those companies that are geared towards multimedia presentation or 
organizations that utilize computer-aided design (CAD).

Some object-oriented databases are designed to work well with object-oriented programming languages such as 
Delphi, Ruby, Python, Perl, Java, C#, Visual Basic .NET, C++, Objective-C and Smalltalk; others have their own programming languages. 
OODBMSs use exactly the same model as object-oriented programming languages.
