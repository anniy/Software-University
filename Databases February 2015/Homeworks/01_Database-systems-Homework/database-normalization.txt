Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and 
tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy.
Normalization involves refactorizing a table into smaller (and less redundant) tables but 
without losing information defining foreign keys in the old table 
referencing the primary keys of the new ones. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, 
deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table
and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.
